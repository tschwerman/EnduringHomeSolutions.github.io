description: Therapists are a vital part of a remodel team when the goal is to age in place or make a home more accessible for a loved one with mobility issues.  Our unique ability to assess a person's needs will translate into a more functional and enjoyable space to use.  Additionally, we bring a unique perspective and knowledge about anatomy, disease progression, and ergonomics that will make a remodel more successful to address your needs. However, we donâ€™t stop there!<br> <br>Once an assessment of you is completed and the home is assessed we will help you develop an action plan to address your needs.  Once a plan is in place we will develop a floor plan layout for the work that is required to be done to give you the safety and confidence you deserve within your home. We can be the intermediary between the contractors you choose and you to help you through the process and help to make sure the process goes smoothly.  We will help schedule contractors for bids and discuss the scope and plan with them at your home. We will walk with you through this process with the goal of helping you live safely and confidently for as long as you wish to live in your home.
