description: Trace Schwerman, PT, DPT, ECHM <br> <br> Trace is a Doctor of Physical Therapy who has partnered with clients in the home health, outpatient and inpatient rehabilitation settings.  From his therapist perspective, he has witnessed how much a home can hinder a clientâ€™s independence. He has observed a disconnect between how therapists and home remodelers address accessibility and fall prevention within homes.  What was once a frustration has now developed into a passion to correct this disconnect.  He was awarded an Executive Certification in Home Modifications from USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology and the National Resource Center on Supportive Housing and Home Modifications.  He will use his expertise to help clients limit safety and fall risks while promoting a feeling of confidence in their home.  Partner with Trace today to regain your independence, achieve greater confidence, and maximize your quality of life. <br> <br> Trace is your Dallas-Fort Worth expert. <br> 832-971-1295 <br> Trace.Schwerman@EnduringHomeSolutions.com
